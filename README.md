Added login.php file 6.4.2012. This file is designed to allow member access to a website using PDO. It interacts with a database (MySQL here) so column names must match. Constants are also defined and used in an external global.php file (not included here). They may be changed and/or must be used with a global file. In this version, after successful login a 'success' message displays. The next stage will allow the user to enter a member's zone after successful login.
